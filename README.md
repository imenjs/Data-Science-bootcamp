    Maximizing revenue and staying competitive. 
    So in this studdy we aim to : 
      Studie Consumer behavior
      Maintaining revenue
      Discount strategies

   Tools: Python, matplotlib and seaborn Library


Project 4 Eniac : AB testing (Eniac website choice of button)

Discription : Eniac's website team settled on 4 different new versions to test against the original “Interact” button:

  Connect
  Learn
  Help
  Services
  
  The metrics that were deemed relevant enough to be tracked were the following:
  
  Click-through rate (CTR) for the homepage : Amount of clicks on the button divided by the total visits to the page.
  Drop-off rate for the category pages: Percentage of visitors who exit the site from a given category page (like Interact, Connect, Learn, etc.) without exploring any of its subpages. A lower drop-off rate is preferable
  Homepage-return rate for the category pages : Measures how often users who visit specific category pages (Interact, Connect, Learn, etc.) from the library homepage end up returning to the homepage. If they frequently     return to the homepage, Ideally, we want to minimize the homepage-return rate, which would indicate that users are finding what they need on the first try.
  it was decided that for a version to be considered superior, a minimum increase in click-through rate of 30% had to be detected.
  The length of the experiment was established at 21 days.

Tools : Chi Squared pairwise Test, Post_hoc Test,
